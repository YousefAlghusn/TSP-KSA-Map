# TSP-KSA-Map
A Desktop app that solves Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using local search algorithms.

Traveling salesman problem (TSP):
Given a set of cities and the distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest 
possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. This problem is easy to 
state and difficult to solve.

The used algorithms are: Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm.
